### template.py
This program builds a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regressor pipeline to predict breast cancer data. It scales the data, then uses GridSearchCV to find the best number of neighbors (1 to 10) with cross-validation. Finally, it outputs the results, showing how different parameter values affect model performance.
